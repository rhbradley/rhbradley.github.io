            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Robert Hampton Bradley, a Program Manager at Raytheon Technologies, based in Fullerton, CA, working remotely. With a strong foundation in engineering and business, I’m passionate about leading teams to deliver innovative solutions that make a real impact. I hold an MBA from Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business (2023, GPA 3.93), a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering (2019, GPA 4.00), and a Bachelor’s in Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics (2018, GPA 3.63), both from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
            <p>In my current role, I manage the profit and loss for a highly technical radar program across various program lifecycles — Production, Sustainment, and Services. I oversee cross-functional teams to meet objectives on time and within budget. Strong execution on program deliverables have strengthened customer trust and has increased demand for our product both domestically and internationally. I thrive at the intersection of technical expertise and strategic leadership, and this site showcases my journey and skills.</p>

            <h2>Personal Interst</h2>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors. I’m an avid skier who loves hitting the slopes in the winter, and when the weather warms up, you can usually find me on the pickleball or tennis court. I also love spending time with my dog, Maizie, whether it’s going for walks, exploring new trails, or just relaxing together.</p>
